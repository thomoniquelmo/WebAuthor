<h1>Thomonique Moore</h1>
<h3>Junior || Information Systems Major </h3>
<br>
<br>
<p> Howdy, I am Thomonique Moore. Most people call me Thomo for short. I am a 21 year old, 3rd year student at Howard University. I'm originally from Virginia Beach, which isn't too far from here. I like to read books and have long conversations about philosphy and feminism in my spare time. I also prefer bars to nightclubs on any given Friday/Saturday night. 
<p>I'm currently a business major, but the longer I stay, the more I realize I have no real <i>interest</i> in it. I hope to get my phd and teach higher education, but right now I'm remaining open to the many possibilities.
